**Yet another open-source component collection.**

_(Not entirely sure what to call this either... shad doesn't call this a
component library, but it's basically [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) with a
few more components you'll probably need... hopefully. Well I did, so chances
are, you might too.)_

Built with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). Backed by solid hooks. Ready to
drop straight into your codebase.

Inspired by approaches like shadcn/ui (or actually built on top of it), this
project gives you copy-pasteable components, wired up with unstyled primitives,
then styled with Tailwind.

It's not a library. It's not a framework.  
Just clean, editable code, ready to use, customize, and make your own.
